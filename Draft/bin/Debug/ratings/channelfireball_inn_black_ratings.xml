    <CardName>Abattoir Ghoul</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>As gross as the picture is, the card might even be grosser in combat. It battles very well, especially with one of the many equipments in the set, and even rewards you for battling. Plus, he's a Zombie, which means that after they expend a bunch of cards and effort to get rid of him, you get to Ghoulraise him right up.</RatingDescription>

    <CardName>Skeletal Grimace</CardName>
    <Rating>1.0</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This isn’t the worst pair of pants I’ve ever seen, but I’m not usually looking to suit up my guys with random auras to begin with. If you’ve gotta run it, at least try and land it while they are tapped out (and don’t compare this to Trollhide, or you are just going to get annoyed).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>  
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Altar's Reap</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I've been surprisingly impressed by this, though I guess since it does draw cards, maybe that isn't so surprising. Both the Zombie deck with Ghoulraisers and the white sacrifice/token deck can easily fuel this, and it still is a 2 for 1 when played in response to removal. If you don't have any good combos with it and most of your creatures are good, don't bother, but most of the time this will make the cut.</RatingDescription>

  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Army of the Damned</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Here, you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; don't need the flashback, since if the first wave doesn't kill them, I'm not sure what will. It costs eight and doesn't block, which is annoying, but it should end the game quite handily. If the format is particularly slow, which I'm not sure about yet, it might go up in value, and it seems really good in Sealed.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Bitterheart Witch</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The base stats alone aren't horrendous here, though they are certainly not exciting. At the very least, the Witch will trade for some random ground guy, but the next part is what will determine how good it actually is. The 64,000 dollar question is: do you have Curse of Death's Hold or not? If not, you aren't getting much of interest. None of the other curses seem particularly backbreaking, even though fetching one for free is probably worth your time. Even getting a mediocre curse makes this playable, due to its defensive capability, and if you are lucky enough to have Death's Hold, Witch becomes a very high pick.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Bloodgift Demon</CardName>
    <Rating>4.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Yep. Not only is this a huge undercosted flier, it draws you two a turn, with the alternate mode of trying to slowly burn them out. It even costs less than most Dragons, making it one of the best cards in the set (black got a lot of them this time around).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Bloodline Keeper</CardName>
    <Rating>4.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>And the award for best transform card goes to…Bloodline Keeper! If I open this, I'm immediately slamming it, even if the guy to my right is also taking a black card; it's just that good. I've even gotten to cast it already, in the best deck I've had so far:</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Brain Weevil</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I like this more than Mind Rot, even if Mind Rot isn't exactly a Limited All-Star. Having the option to peck in for a point a turn is nice, and enabling morbid at will is even better. I usually end up playing this, even if I'm not all that thrilled about it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Bump in the Night</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is essentially a multicolored Lava Axe, so if the B/R deck you are running would be interested in the Axe, this is a fine playable. It has some minor synergies with cards like Burning Vengeance and Runic Repetition, though I'd certainly hope not to be a Grixis Lava Axe deck. Black-Red doesn't feel all that beatdown to me, but maybe I've just drafted more controlling versions so far just due to my natural tendencies.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Corpse Lunge</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Lunges lose value incredibly quickly, depending on the rest of your deck. The first, with no Skaab guys, is certainly good, but subsequent ones greatly increase the risk of you ending up with uncastables in hand. I haven't come close to cutting one yet, but I have definitely passed them for worse cards, just because I don't want to cram my deck full of situational nonsense, even if that nonsense is removal.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of Death's Hold</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>In my very first Innistrad draft, I got this fourth, and happily snapped up a Bitterheart Witch fifth. It was probably only because it was the first draft that this went so late, since after playing with it, I can attest as to its effectiveness. Even if it doesn't outright kill all their creatures, it weakens them significantly, and only against green and its werewolves was it not completely devastating (though it was still good).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of Oblivion</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This shares the same drawbacks as other graveyard hate spells, along with a few unique ones of its own…it is slow, it isn't targeted, and it costs more mana. It is a little more effective against the Skaab clan deck, so keep that in mind, though they can just mill and play their guys immediately if they have to. I'll be surprised if I ever have this in play during this format.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Dead Weight</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Here, I'm glad to trade instant speed for the option of weakening a larger creature, making this one of the top commons in the set. I usually don't weight for better targets, since it doesn't usually deal with their high end anyways, so just run it out early.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Diregraf Ghoul</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Sure, why not? It isn't a great card, obviously, seeing as it's just a 2/2, but it is a Zombie, and it is cheap. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Disciple of Griselbrand</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You have to have some serious morbid synergy going on before playing this, and some light token-making or Ghoulraising wouldn't hurt either. I've yet to see this get in there, and suspect that it won't most of the time.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Endless Ranks of the Dead</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Here it's a little more likely that you can amass an army of Zombies, even if not by much. Needing two Zombies in play to make one a turn is tough, since it is just way too easy for things to go wrong. If you have 10+ Zombies, I like the card, but that doesn't seem like it will be common so far.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Falkenrath Noble</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>There aren't many cards more dangerous than this; Disciple of the Vault plus lifegain on ANY creature is insane. With the Noble in play, all you have to do is survive, and you will probably win, since the advantage he gives you in a long game is huge. Building around him is even better, what with tokens and the like, which makes him that much better. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ghoulcaller's Chant</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You don't actually need Zombies to call this a playable, and if you do have 5+ Zombies, it becomes quite desirable. It probably isn't worth getting too greedy, but if you can afford to, wait until you get full value.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ghoulraiser</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Card advantage is card advantage, even if it takes a little work. I've played this with as few as two other Zombies, and it was fine, though I'd recommend trying to pick up more. I'm not a huge fan of it getting a guy at random, but whatever, I'll take an extra card.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Gruesome Deformity</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Things would have to get pretty ugly before I'd play this, and ideally they never do.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Heartless Summoning</CardName>
    <Rating>0</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I'd really like to see the deck where this is good, and will actually issue a challenge to that effect (summoning Travis Woo to the draft area). I won't mind being proven wrong, though I doubt it's gonna happen.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Liliana of the Veil</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Liliana actually isn't the most absurd thing ever in Limited, though she still is quite good. You aren't going to be able to reliably turn the +1 into a big advantage, so she is basically just an Edict machine. Sounds good to me!</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Manor Skeleton</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The really important part of this card is the Haste, since that's what really ties it all together. Past that, it still blocks reasonably well, and is about what it looks like; a mediocre blocker, and a solid (if unexciting) playable.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Markov Patrician</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The most common use for this is as a reverse Searing Blaze; you will play it, trade it for some random ground creature, and gain three. That's a good deal, and if you do manage to clear the path via removal, the life swing is huge.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Maw of the Mire</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>They would have to be playing some really absurd brew before I'd ask Maw for help, and even then the plan is suspect. I suppose there is also the possibility that it is worth siding this in against a burn type deck, but that also seems sketchy.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Moan of the Unhallowed</CardName>

  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Morkrut Banshee</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>So far, this has been less impressive than I initially thought it would be. I'm not saying that I'm going to pass it very often, but activating it is more difficult than it looks. It seems like it kills a guy around half the times it's drawn, which makes it good but not windmill-slam great (especially once they know about it).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Night Terrors</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I'm at the point where I almost always maindeck the first Night Terrors, and run the second about 1/3 of the time. It's a very solid turn three play, and exiling instead of just discarding is obviously quite relevant. As with most discard, it's a bad topdeck, but that shouldn't scare you away from running it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Reaper from the Abyss</CardName>
    <Rating>4.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Yeah, this card is real. How did black get all the insane cards this time around?</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Rotting Fensnake</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I'm not saying the Snake is awesome, but it combines well with both morbid and Ghoulraiser, since it almost always ends up in the graveyard within a turn of being cast. It's fine defensively, trading for many of the bigger guys, and does enough that I usually play it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Screeching Bat</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Either side is basically fine, and more often than not this lives out its life as a Bat. If you have nothing to do, go ahead and flip it on turn five, but hopefully that isn't the case. I do find it funny that this Vampire can be a Victim of Night while unflipped, as has happened in my drafts already.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Sever the Bloodline</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Swords to Plowshares with Flashback? Yeah, I'll take it. I've already seen Tom Raney flash this back off of two Shimmering Grottos with Islands and Forests in play, not to mention red cards, so mise.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Skirsdag High Priest</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You don't really have to do much work for this guy to win you the game; all you need is him and two friends, and for something to die. Even if he never gets activated, he puts your opponent in an awkward spot, and likely makes them unable to attack or block effectively. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Stromkirk Patrol</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Man, I thought I had it good when I picked up a Zombie Goliath or two. This guy certainly isn't amazing, but your 22nd-23rd cards have to come from somewhere, and they may as well be here. Plus, this ability pressures people way more than it should, and will likely instigate some pretty bad blocks over the course of the next few months.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Tribute to Hunger</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Edicts are never that impressive in Limited, at least when compared to Constructed. They can be pretty solid if you put in some work, and have cards like Geistflame to clear out the chaff first. This is a fine card, and close enough to removal to count as such. Also, instant, werewolves, etc.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Typhoid Rats</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I've left this in the board before, but that isn't going to be a common occurrence. Against green, it's fantastic, trading for any and everything they can muster up. Against other colors, results may vary, but bear in mind that blue is trying to beat down with common 4/5's now. It usually won't be great against white, or if you have a very aggressive deck, so sideboard it out as needed.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Unbreathing Horde</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Once you get a critical mass of Zombies (I feel like I keep saying that, but I guess that's the tribe's gimmick), this is a bruiser, and unlike ENDLESS RANKS OF THE DEAD, it doesn't matter if the Zombies survive or not. Don't take it early, since you are going to be the only one interested in it, and try to have at least 8-10 Zombies before running it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Unburial Rites</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Most of the multicolor flashback cards give you good incentives to be those colors, and Unburial Rites is the best of them all. You have to have some halfway decent creatures, but that's really all. It's definitely worth splashing, and U(b/w) seems to be a common color combination. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Vampire Interloper</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Formats come and go, but beatdowns are eternal. The two-mana evasion guy that can’t block has been excellent every time, and I don’t expect this one to suck (except for maybe blood. Because he’s a Vampire).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Victim of Night</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>On the high end of the 3.5's, Victim of Night has no shortage of victims, even against the most monstrous of monster decks. Oh, I'm also going to refer to the Vampire, Werewolf, Zombie combination as “monsters” from now on, here and in drafts, just for simplicity's sake. I haven't been disappointed yet, and even if this misses here and there, you can always find something to kill.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>


  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Village Cannibals</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>There are enough humans running around that I would play this even if I had none, and that isn't even the most likely scenario. It's still a 2/2 for three, which is passable, making the ability more of a bonus than anything else. If you are light on humans and they seem to be missing from the opponent's deck, feel free to sideboard this out, but I'd start it most of the time.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Walking Corpse</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The cards this most reminds me of are actually Kami of Ancient Law and Glory Seeker (only while in Onslaught). Like them, it's just a bear, but served to power up other cards, the card in question being Ghoulraiser. Getting back a 2/2 might not be the most exciting, but it sure beats getting back nothing, and there are some other random Zombie synergies &lt;strike&gt;running&lt;/strike&gt;shambling around as well. Plus, it's still a 2/2 for two, and those tend to be fine.</RatingDescription>
