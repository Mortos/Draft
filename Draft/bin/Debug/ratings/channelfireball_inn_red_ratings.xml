    <CardName>Ancient Grudge</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>With all the handy household implements the humans in this set seem to be fond of, I certainly wouldn’t object to having a Grudge in my sideboard, but I’m not really looking to maindeck one.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ashmouth Hound</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This little doggie battles pretty well, easily taking down 3-4 casting cost creatures, and even blanking a number of opposing foes. It is still soft to cards like Geistflame, but you should be able to get plenty of mileage out of it otherwise.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Balefire Dragon</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Ah, the classic “dragon that wins the game when it attacks” that is in every set. As usual, it’s good, and the format even seems slow enough to make it a very viable plan.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Blasphemous Act</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’ve talked about how mediocre Wrath effects tend to be in Limited before, but I’ve never been afraid to beat a dead horse, so here we go. It’s hard to convince your opponent to overextend without playing something out, limiting the total cards gained, and once the opponent knows about them, it won’t work very well at all. This even gets harder than most Wraths, since if they stop at two guys, you might not even be able to cast it. That all being said, it does blow up the world, and having access to that is certainly better than not.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Bloodcrazed Neonate</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you don’t have removal to back it up, the drawback is quite significant. Even in a deck with two Rakish Heirs and eight removal spells, I had to chump attack more often than I was happy with. Plus, even if you do get a solid hit in, they can usually just trade the second time around.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Brimstone Volley</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It’s pretty hard to go wrong with this; it either is a very solid three damage for three mana, or it overperforms and blasts a five-toughness guy, with the additional option of going to the face. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Burning Vengeance</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You need a ton of flashback before this becomes an option, and I highly doubt that’s going to happen very often. If it does, the more power to you, and I’d love to play that deck, but I’m not taking Burning Vengeance early in anticipation of such.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Charmbreaker Devils</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>My favorite combo with this so far is Into the Maw of Hell, but even something as tame as a Geistflame should be good value. Plus, it even comes with an 8/4 monster, which sadly means that I don’t get to cast Into the Maw very often before the game ends.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Crossway Vampires</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The casting cost is a little tough, but the stats are solid and the ability is relevant. The best use seems to be following up a Bloodcrazed Neonate, and then ideally having another good play on turn four, such as Nightbird’s Clutches. If you have less than 10 Mountains, the utility of this drops enormously, so keep that in mind.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of Stalked Prey</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>A special set of circumstances has to exist before this becomes a good playable; you have to have plenty of creatures, plenty of removal, and still space for this durdle card. So far it’s been left on the bench more often than not, because those conditions are somewhat hard to meet. It’s tough finding room for a non-creature non-removal spell that only works when your guys are hitting them.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of the Nightly Hunt</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Strangely enough, this is very similar to Curse of Stalked Prey; you need space for a do-nothing, and creatures enough to make it a do-something. At least this one is a little more brutal; playing this in order to make one or two guys chump attack gets them pretty good. Red-green seems like the obvious combination for this, but it also shines as a sideboard card if your guys outclass theirs.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of the Pierced Heart</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I'm not entirely sold on this yet. Even if you are the deck playing Bump in the Night, any random 2-drop is likely to do more damage, and can actually block. If you don't have enough creatures, you might have to run this, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like the optimal situation. You want burn to finish the game, not be in your opening hand.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Desperate Ravings</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>What can I say, I’m a sucker for card advantage. You obviously have to be both colors to get full value, since playing this just for the red half is a desperate gambit indeed. It fills the graveyard, though hopefully not with your best cards, and lets you go deep in the lategame (remember to hold excess lands and all that).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Devil’s Play</CardName>
    <Rating>5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>By all that’s right and just in this world, couldn’t this at least be mythic? I’ve played with and against it, and it’s exactly as absurd as it looks. I’m not playing around when I say that this is the best card in the set, since it covers all the bases: it’s a two for one, it can win the game by itself, and it deals with all the other bombs. At least the flashback isn’t splashable, though the main part is, and I can’t imagine this will get passed very often. I mean, Fireball you for 9, Fireball you for 7 just isn’t fair (and neither is Fireball your guy turn four, flash it back 10 turns later).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Falkenrath Marauders</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you can get the first hit in, they probably can’t block it, and it soon turns into The Abyss. This guy is gonna Falk some people up, that’s for sure.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Feral Ridgewolf</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The mana investment is just too high on this to really make it worth it; unlike Kessig Wolf, you have to pay mana just to trade with their guy. I get that it’s a mana sink so you can flip your Werewolves, but that doesn’t excuse it just being a bad card.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Furor of the Bitten</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>A mediocre advantage with a significant drawback, all in Aura form? Sign me up!</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Geistflame</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Geistflame has impressed me so far; it never gets less than a card, in total, even if sometimes you need to use both halves. When you get a whole card for half of this, it makes you feel less bad about running the block + Geistflame combo on one of their bigger guys, which ends up happening often. I like this, and would happily play multiples in my maindeck.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Hanweir Watchkeep/Bane of Hanweir</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I like either half of this, though it probably isn’t surprising that I’m a fan of a 1/5. I’d play a 1/5 defender most of the time regardless, and having the option to flip into a 5/5 is nothing to sneeze at. Plus, look at that badass crossbow/arbalest thingie he has!</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Harvest Pyre</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This bears remarkable similarities to Corpse Lunge, and I bet it isn’t too hard to figure out why. Depending on your deck, one may be easier to power than the other, and the first one or two are fine without any additional effort on your part. Once you start to try and jam three or more in there, you really are gonna need some Forbidden Alchemies or Desperate Ravings to enable them.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Heretic’s Punishment</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I guess you don’t get actual infinite shots, but if you need more than the six or seven you normally get, you weren’t winning anyway. The biggest cost is obviously the time, though eating their best creature every turn usually solves that as well. If you miss, you probably do get punished, for what it’s worth.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Infernal Plunge</CardName>
    <Rating>0</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I don’t care how many morbid cards you have, this is just unacceptable.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Instigator Gang/Wildblood Pack</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>There will be blood if this comes out, since they aren’t living through very many 8-point attacks, and that’s not even taking into consideration the bonus given to the rest of your team. This is one of the few flip cards I don’t mind taking first, and even sends a good signal.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Into the Maw of Hell</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Plague Spores you! The colors might be less intense in this set, so the land destruction part isn’t as relevant, but the relative dearth of removal means that the deal 13 is much more valuable. Removal is rare in the land of Innistrad, so use it wisely.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Kessig Wolf </CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>He may not be super exciting, but you are realistically never cutting this from a base-red deck. Worst comes to worst, you trade off when they attack, and usually he bashes without you needing to spend mana.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Night Revelers</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you need a Bonecrusher Giant, he’s your man, and even has haste some 10% of the time (or whatever the number actually is).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Nightbird’s Clutches</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Don’t let the low rating fool you; when it’s good, it’s very good. The beauty of this is that you will get it late for exactly that reason. You obviously have to be very aggressive, at which point it becomes a pretty sick double-Falter.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Past in Flames</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’d be impressed if you could draft a deck where this is great, considering how much mana it takes. If Dead Weight was a Sorcery, it would be a lot more plausible; exactly how many spells do you expect to play after casting a 4-5 mana one?</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Pitchburn Devils</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Never has a two for one been so easy. All you have to do is cast this, and your job is basically done! 3/3 is big enough to trade for just about anything, letting the Devils pitch themselves at another hapless target. If you have the misfortune to play against green, or let white flip Thraben Sentry, you can even settle for getting just one card and trade away both halves of the Devils. I like this card, and anticipate it going later than it should, because 3/3’s for five always seem dorky.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Rage Thrower</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It may not be the fastest, or even all that big, but any board with a Rage Thrower is a dangerous board for the opponent. They can’t take that many two-point shots and live to tell the tale, so once you have this out, all you have to do is survive and he will take care of the rest. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Rakish Heir</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The fact that he grows himself makes him quite playable, and once you start getting into the realm of four or five other Vampires, you are talking about a legitimately good card.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Reckless Waif</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’d just about always run this, if only for the mise factor of having it in your opener in just crushing them. It isn’t great, by any means, but it seems reasonable.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Riot Devils</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is the definition of filler; if your curve/creature count demands it, it’s in there.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Rolling Temblor</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’m actually way less happy with this than I expected. It looks good, but doesn’t play all that well. There really aren’t all that many guys that die to it, and it often ends up being very awkward. I wouldn’t fault you for benching it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Scourge of Geier Reach</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If this is at its smallest, they don’t have much out. Hooray! If it’s huge, it dominates the board. Also hooray!</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Skirsdag Cultist</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’ve yet to see this in play and not be good. Turning any creature into a Shock is sweet, and even more so when you consider how removal-light this set is as a whole. Tack on how well it enables Morbid, or plays with white’s token-making, and you have a card that every deck wants.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Stromkirk Noble</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is about as boring as it gets. If you need the 3/2 for four, run it, but otherwise steer clear. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Traitorous Blood</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The usual caveats about aggressiveness apply, though there are a couple legitimate sac outlets this time as well. If you have ‘em, great, and if not, make sure you are beating down before you run this.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Vampiric Fury</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Talk about situational pump spells; unless you are on 7+ Vampires (ideally + is like 10), this is pretty bad.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Village Ironsmith</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The value of cheap Werewolves goes up quite a bit, since it is not uncommon for the opponent to miss a two-drop, whereas they are rarely missing a three. The one toughness on both sides is kind of weak, but Ironfang gets through well enough, making this playable if not something you can really sink your fangs into.</RatingDescription>
