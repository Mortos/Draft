  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Diregraf Captain</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>On his own, he tangles with any large creature and at least takes it down, and it's difficult to not accumulate a few other Zombies if you are UB, even unintentionally. All of the Captains are great in Limited, and this one is no exception.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Drogskol Captain</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You aren't too likely to double Captain in Limited, not that you really need to. UW fliers is already a good archetype, and drafting this early gives you a good direction to go. It's certainly a signal, and I've never seen it go later than 3rd or 4th in any of our drafts.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Drogskol Reaver</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>As expensive as this is, at least Lifelink means it blocks multiple things the turn it comes out, which is good, since you are probably behind at that point. I can't imagine smashing with this and still losing, so it ends the game quickly, and overall is kind of what you want in a finisher (though whether you even need finishers in this format is debatable).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Falkenrath Aristocrat</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Even ignoring the indestructible part, this bashes for a ton of damage in a short amount of time, and letting you trade your worst creature for their blocker certainly doesn't hurt. It still doesn't feel Mythic, but it does the job, and is better than most of the common removal spells.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Havengul Lich</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>In most formats, this would be a solid 4, but this format is looking to be fast enough that I think Lich is closer to 3.5. It's a great card, and I would just about always slam it, but it puts you into a two-color combination that I don't love, and is still a little slow. As un-fun as it may be, sometimes you just have to take the removal spell over the sweet Mythic.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Huntmaster of the Fells</CardName>
    <Rating>4.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This actually does it all for Limited, since not only do you get a ridiculous bomb, everyone around you knows it, and knows that it's going to be very difficult to get you out of RG. If you open this, slam it immediately, just to make sure your neighbors consider passing red and green for equivalent cards of other colors, which will make your draft go very smoothly.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Immerwolf</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The bonus ability on these guys is the real clincher. Immerwolf would be an outstanding card if all it did was pump other Wolves and make them unable to flip back, and he even gets to intimidate the opposition as well. Seeing one of the Captain cycle late is a good sign, and shouldn't happen all that often.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Sorin, Lord of Innistrad</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Following the footsteps of planeswalkers before him, Sorin is ridiculous in Limited and you should never pass him. That is all.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Stromkirk Captain</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Granting pseudo-evasion to your Vampires is nice, and the decks that will best use Captain Kirk here are aggressive ones, where if he gets two guys in for a combat step his job is done. The power level on this Captain is a little lower than on some of the others, so I'm less likely to take him quite as early, even if RB is a good color combination.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Altar of the Lost</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I dream of having the deck I can place at the Altar of the Lost, but so far it hasn't happened. If you manage to get 7+ good flashback spells, the dream may become reality, and I'm sure it's going to occur once Dark Ascension is released for drafting online.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Avacyn's Collar</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It's obvious that the Collar doesn't go into just any deck, so the rating reflects how good it is in the decks that want it. A solid Human count is really the only thing that matters, since the other bonuses, while decent, aren't enough to make this card worth playing on its own.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Chalice of Life</CardName>
    <Rating>0</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Even Indiana Jones wouldn't be able to select the playable chalice, since it truly doesn't exist.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Elbrus, the Binding Blade</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You have no idea how much I want to play this, but I'm afraid that if I do, BenS will fly here from Florida to forcibly make me take it out of my deck. I wish this card was just a little bit cheaper/better, since there's nothing I'd love to do more than smash with it, but that is just not realistic in the slightest. Rest assured that my goal online will be to transform this, so I'll be doing what I can to make that happen.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Executioner's Hood</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This deserves a sideboard-only rating because it's the definition of a (bad) sideboard card. You will never maindeck it, and every so often you might board it in, once you see how the games go.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Grafdigger's Cage</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Once again, maindecking a card like this is suicide, but siding it in against the Burning Vengeance deck is quite effective.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Heavy Mattock</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Even in a Human-heavy deck, this is a bit clunky, weighty, slow, and of excessive mass, so you should probably not be thrilled to play it. In a non-Human deck, it has no shot.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Helvault</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Predator, Flagship just isn't what it used to be, not only because of this format's speed, but because of the possibility of getting this blown up and having all Hel break loose. I've certainly lost games to this, but that's from both sides of the table, since some were due to my reliance on spending a million mana on a failed plan. Take it, and even play it, but be aware that many decks won't want it, and those tend to be the better ones.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Jar of Eyeballs</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you want to settle into a long grindy game, Jar of Eyeballs is perfect for you. On the other hand, this draft format isn't. As much as I like to sit back, trade off creatures, milking the Jar for all it's worth (isn't that a pleasant visual?), this format doesn't lend itself nicely to that gameplan, and hence the relatively low rating on the Jar. Jayemdae Tomes just aren't what they used to be.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Warden of the Wall</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I don't want to sound like a broken record, but defensive control decks just aren't the way to go here, and that's exactly what Warden of the Wall is good in. It's still a fine card, and a decent sideboard against UW fliers, but most decks just don't have room for a defense-only card.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Wolfhunters Quiver</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I've been told I like this more than I should, but it's been decent for me. It's definitely slow and should be used with caution, yet the effect it has on the game is surprisingly large. Just having it in play changes how they have to play their turns, even if you never end up equipping it, and against actual Werewolf decks it's brutal. I keep harping on how slow cards are bad, but this particular slow card has actually performed for me.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Evolving Wilds</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you are just two colors, this isn't a high priority, so don't concern yourself overmuch during the draft. If you are planning on splashing some flashback action, or maybe anticipate a Brimstone Volley, Evolving Wilds is your guy, and you should snap them up in the 5-7th pick range. I realize that you won't know exactly whether you are splashing or not that early, so just base it on how greedy you are. Me, I take my Wilds early and often.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Grim Backwoods</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you are both these colors, go nuts. If you aren't, don't bother splashing this, or really even taking it very high. Much like in Constructed, spending a turn on nothing is kind of tough to make work.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Haunted Fengraf</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>In a straight 2-color deck, I expect to play this less than half the time. The loss of tempo and the cost, plus the fact that it returns at random, just all combine to make this not quite worth it in decks with less than perfect mana.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Vault of the Archangel</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Not only do I like BW as a color combination already, this turns the tide in close games and helps you pull ahead on those you are winning. If you are too far behind on board, maybe it doesn't do enough, but you only need a creature or two to make this a reasonable threat. It can lead to boards where you just pass, leaving this up, and the don't attack, but those are likely games you were going to lose anyway.</RatingDescription>
