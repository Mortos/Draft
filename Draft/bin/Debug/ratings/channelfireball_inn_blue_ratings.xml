    <CardName>Armored Skaab</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Not only is he a Horned Turtle, he's got a pretty sweet bonus tacked on. In a good blue deck, Armored Skaab is real nice; he fills your graveyard for the rest of the Skaab clan maulers, he dumps in Flashback cards, and he even provides targets for Unburial Rites. Some decks won't have much for him, but milling for four randomly still isn't a huge drawback, so you might end up running him anyway.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Back from the Brink</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This card doesn't seem very beatable in any sort of long game, and gets even more sick when combined with milling effects. If you are getting beaten down, it doesn't help a whole lot, but if you have the time, you get a near-infinite supply of gas. Granted, it doesn't combine well with Skaabs, but I think you will be able to manage if you draft enough enablers (and if you have this, you should).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Battleground Geist</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Much like Gallows Warden (weird), this is a decent flier with an unspectacular but relevant ability. I wouldn't be excited to pick it, but I'll always play it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Cackling Counterpart</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Despite picking this second, I've yet to actually play with it (I got cut on blue in that draft). It seems awesome, if a little win-more at times. Here, needing a good creature is less of a drawback, since there isn't so much removal that all your guys are going to die, and many of the common removal spells are secretly enchantments that don't actually kill the creature. Plus, it's an instant, which I didn't even notice at first. Combat blowouts are definitely possible, though I'd hope not on the flashback, for your opponent's sake.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Civilized Scholar</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>A Looter is a Looter, and having the option to go on the warpath is pretty awesome. Plus, you even get to send a signal when taking this, which is actually an advantage. I don't think the flip cards have all the big an impact on draft, since most aren't first picks, but this one definitely is, and being able to signal properly is nice. It also works very well with flashback, Skaab dudes, and the like, so it might even be better than normal here.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Claustrophobia</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It's pretty hard to go wrong with this, due to the trigger it has. You do get blown out by Village Bell-Ringer, but that isn't a huge concern. Blue doesn't often get actual removal, and it's a nice to see some for a change (since blue usually sucks in Limited, or so I'd like you to believe).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curiosity</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you have good evasion this is pretty sweet, even if still somewhat risky. If you don't, well, you are going to find out why curiosity killed the cat. It's obviously insane with Invisible Stalker, and even on something like Chapel Geist, you should be able to get a solid hit in, at which point you at the very least break even on cards.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of the Bloody Tome</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>So far I haven't seen any indication that an actual mill deck exists, but if it does, this is certainly a part of it. I would like mill to be good, since I like sweet archetypes, and hopefully this makes it happen (though I'm not holding my breath). Milling yourself is also viable, just not with this card, since you can't turn it off when you want to.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Delver of Secrets</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Hoping to mise is one thing, and actually working for it is another. Playing him in a deck with 9+ spells seems ok; any less than that and you are just trying to mise. He also combines well with Deranged Assistant, since you can mill unwanted cards after taking a peek. In fact, you might not even flip the Fly here, if you want a pseudo-Divining Top more than a 3/2 flier.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Deranged Assistant</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The rating on this card will vary heavily, depending on (drumroll please) how well you utilize the graveyard. If you have a bunch of Zombie Frankensteins you need to feed and cards to flash back, Deranged Assistant is about as good as it gets; if you don't, it's still a solid mana accelerator. Rare will be the blue deck with absolutely no use for self-milling, though not every deck really needs it. I suspect that this is one of those really important enablers, and is a higher pick than the cards it fuels (for the most part). I would much rather end up heavy on enablers than cards the require them, since at least then you get to play Magic.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Dissipate</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Here's an easy way to judge if I'll like a Limited format: is Cancel good? If so, I'll be happy. As it turns out, I think Dissipate is good, and that's even without the nifty RFG clause, which this thankfully has. Werewolves do make draw-go a little worse, but that isn't a reason to throw this out, and I think I'm always starting it in decks that can get UU reliably.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Dream Twist</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Deranged Assistant and Forbidden Alchemy are awesome because they give you a card &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; mill you; remove the card, and the dream turns into a nightmare. If your deck is either very horrible, and has 6 Skaabs and no good enablers, run this. Likewise, if your deck is the nuts and has 7 Flashback cards and a ton of good synergies, also run this. Anything in between and you should steer clear.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Forbidden Alchemy</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Much like Deranged Assistant, Forbidden Alchemy is a powerful enabler and great even in the non-comboish decks. It is a multicolor card, but the flashback is quite splashable, and I've seen it fit quite nicely into a number of 3-color decks so far. Due to its natural card advantage and excellent synergy, I would be surprised if this wasn't one of the higher picks.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Fortress Crab</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Armor up! As passive as this card is, it buys you time, and most blue decks are well set up to take advantage of that. Returns are definitely diminishing here, so as long as you have one or two you should be set. Also, if you don't have a good lategame or a bunch of fliers, this actually doesn't do much, so make sure you have one or the other.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Frightful Delusion</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Runeboggle this isn't, and Runeboggle was no all-star. Not being able to cycle this is pretty bad, getting their worst card instead doesn't make up for it. It's an ok sideboard card against decks full of expensive nonsense, but a very mediocre maindeck one.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Grasp of Phantoms</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Time Stretch is a nice card, and this isn't much different. The prerelease was just a few days ago, and I've still seen this card be the full blown like three times. Grasp your guy, bash, do it again, is just filthy, and even if you have other stuff to do, it's still a two for one. This is definitely a case of adding flashback taking a card from playable (since it would be, straight up) to insane.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Hysterical Blindness</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>While this is certainly no prize pig, it does have some uses. Thanks to the oft-mentioned Skaab, opponents will actually be double-blocking blue's creatures more often than normal, at which point you strike! Blindness wrecks double blocks very handily, which still doesn't make it great. If you need filler, I'm sure these will be readily available.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Invisible Stalker</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you have absolutely no way to pump or otherwise utilize the Stalker (if you are curious about what I mean, I'm sure you can figure it out), it really isn't great. A 1/1 for one just isn't a fast clock. On the other hand, if you do have something like Butcher's Cleaver, game on! Even the less good equipment is sweet, since Cleaver is the best possible, and something as pedestrian as putting Elder Cathar counters on the Stalker (Humans4Life) does the trick.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Laboratory Maniac</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Hey, it's still a 2/2 for three. If you have enough self-milling nonsense, this isn't a bad backup win condition, especially if you can slowroll it. Playing this with a Think Twice in your bin and no cards in deck is awesome, since you can just pass and use Think Twice only if they have removal, seeing as they are forced to kill it before your turn.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Lantern Spirit</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>A two-power flier for three mana that protects itself efficiently isn't something you are going to tern down, even if it dies to most other creatures. One-toughness fliers are worse in this set than most, thanks to the abundance of spirit tokens in white, yet this still is a solid pick.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Lost in the Mist</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is the perfect card to top off your curve; if you untap with this in hand and a board advantage, it's pretty tough to lose. That being said, five-mana counters aren't the best when behind, especially if the opponent has the temerity to play around them. Many games will be won or lost based on whether people play around or into this card, and I hopefully I'm on the right side of them.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ludevic's Test Subject/Ludevic's Abomination</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>After watching the Ocho win every single game with this in his sealed on Saturday, I may be a bit biased, but it seems pretty sweet. It's clearly better in sealed, but it looks pretty reasonable in draft. 13/13 is just so monstrous, and it isn't like you are forced to use it at all times. Plus, it even blocks well enough untransformed, making it a good egg indeed.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Makeshift Mauler</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>He truly is the Mauler of the Skaab clan, since he is large, common, and relatively easy to enable. The best blue decks are going to have as many of these as they can support, along with a healthy helping of Drakes, and possibly a Goliath if they are lucky. Blue has some bruisers this time around, a trend I'm a fan of. I like powerful cards that take some work, and that's exactly what this is.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Memory's Journey</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Sideboard, sideboard sideboard. I can't think of a set in recent memory that would warrant maindecking such a card, up to and including Innistrad. If they have an actual metric ton of graveyard business, this could be good, but I suspect cases like that will be few and far between.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Mindshrieker</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>And you thought Drifting Shade was sweet! Ok, maybe just I thought Drifting Shade was sweet, what with my affinity for Consume Spirit and all, but still. Mindshrieker is a very fast clock, hard to beat in combat, and worst comes to worst, can just mill them out. You can't even really attack into it, since you never know how big it'll be, and if they play conservatively, it dodges most removal. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Mirror-Mad Phantasm</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The Phantasm doesn't brawl very well, but neither does it die to removal very often. Milling yourself by some amount isn't bad either, though it obviously can be a bit risky, seeing as how it can just be in the bottom five or something. The stats alone make this worth the spot if you can remove their blockers or pump its toughness, and the ability is a nice little addition.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Moon Heron</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>But it sure is a Limited one! In this set, it even gets a slight boost, seeing as how it's a Spirit, and a few cards boost them.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Murder of Crows</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Awesome name, good stats, and a very relevant ability. Rarely does the Air Elemental slot contain so much awesome.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Rooftop Storm</CardName>
    <Rating>0</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>At six mana, you are just paying too much for this, even if you want to go infinite with two Ghoulraisers and a sac outlet. Infinite Storm count, anyone?</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Runic Repetition</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Don't let the low rating fool you; you want to play this in your deck. It won't happen very often, but when it does, it should be awesome. Bringing back Forbidden Alchemy may be excessive, so why not bring back something like Unburial Rites, or even Devil&amp;#8217;s Play if you are a giant sack.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Selhoff Occultist</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>On stats alone, he isn't the worst, and the ability is minorly useful. Be warned, though: the ability isn't optional, so even if your deck can't take advantage of it, it is likely that your opponent's can, and you have to mill someone. Usually it'll still be you, unless you anticipate the game going long enough, in which case you might as well try to deck them.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Sensory Deprivation</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I've been impressed with this thus far, since it basically does what you want it to do. It does leave them with a chump blocker and all, and doesn't kill huge things, but for one mana (and that mana being blue), it's still a good deal. I could do without the picture though, for whatever that's worth.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Silent Departure</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Being able to undo multiple turns of effort is pretty sweet, especially considering the prevalence of Werewolves in the set. If they skip their fourth or fifth turn to flip a Wolf, and you run this, not only are they set way far back, you have another bite at the apple later. Between that and the ability to just double bounce and smash, blue gets yet another winner.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Skaab Goliath</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is the finisher of choice for blue, and is even very splashable. By the time this is ready to come out, it isn't hard for there to be two guys in the bin, and 6/9 trample is a monstrous set of stats. I've seen this end a ton of games, and have concluded that you should rarely be passing it. I also anticipate saying “Goliath online” every time I cast it in draft, so be warned.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Snapcaster Mage</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Look, it's another card that gives flying in the color with many fliers. What sweet irony! This actually isn't the worst, since you can throw it on a Makeshift Mauler and go to town, though I wouldn't really be interested in playing multiples if I could avoid it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Stitched Drake</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Having this guy be a common is nuts, since along with Makeshift Mauler, it really powers up blue. Not only does blue have a bunch of ways to fill up the bin, it has two commons that hugely incentivize you to do so. Stitched Drake is one of blue's most important cards, and utilizing it correctly is going to be the key to drafting a sick blue deck.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Stitcher's Apprentice</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Even straight up, Stitcher's Apprentice is good protection for your squad, and once you start comboing Ghoulraisers or Unruly Mobs, things get filthy. I'm really a fan of all the tricky stuff going on in this set, and as usual, blue is at the forefront. I do legitimately think it was the worst color in M12, so turnabout is fair play, right? Oh also, don't be afraid to just upgrade the Apprentice into a bear if need be.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Sturmgeist</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It grows! If this can't get through immediately, just wait a turn or two, and smash. One hit and it will never stop attacking, and it usually gets to get in there right away. It might not be the best topdeck, and it certainly is annoying to have a reason to hold excess lands in hand, but those are minor complaints compared to how good the card is.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Think Twice</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is a deceptive 3; you always play Think Twice, and it is never bad, exactly, but some decks shouldn't take it over actual cards. Card draw is only as good as the rest of your deck in Limited, so you will often find yourself filling out whatever is missing rather than picking this up. Still, it does make every milling effect that much better, so take it if you can afford it (and figuring that out is going to be the fun part).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Undead Alchemist</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>In a non-Zombie deck, this is just a four-drop that gives you great value when it hits. In a half-Zombie deck, it's a very threatening four-drop that makes a few of your random creatures much more dangerous, and might force them into some bad blocks. In a full on George Romero's Dawn of the Resident Evil Dead 28 Days and Weeks Later sort of situation, they better hunker down, kill it on sight, and hope you don't have a Ghoulraiser. Only the difficulty of assembling the third option makes this anything less than a windmill slam first pick, since it really is just insane when it gets going.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Skaab Ruinator</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>While very powerful, this is definitely a card you have to build around, since it can very easily be stuck dead in your hand if you aren't careful. Most decks will still gladly play it, but it won't truly be insane unless you are able to aggressively mill yourself. Just playing it out of your graveyard once seems so absurd, and the more ways you have to make that happen, the better.</RatingDescription>
