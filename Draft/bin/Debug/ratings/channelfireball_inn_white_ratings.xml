    <CardName>Abbey Griffin</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The four-mana 2/2 flier is an old standy, and I don't see that changing this time. Vigilance is fairly unimpressive on a 2/2, but it'll still swing some games, especially if you have some decent equipment. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Angel of Flight Alabaster</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The fact that this would be a solid 3.5 without the second ability makes it pretty easy to pin a rating on. I don't know how many Spirits you will naturally end up with, but with this in your pile you probably want to prioritize them slightly (though not by an absurd amount).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Angelic Overseer</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This not only beats in for five, if you have white's most common creature type in play, they can't even do anything about it. Sounds about right.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Avacynian Priest</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>A tapper is a tapper, and even though he might not be at his best in some matchups, he will still be more than fine. Just pray you don't run into the all-human deck and you should be good to go.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Bonds of Faith</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I really like cards like this; it's a perfect way to make Giant Strength awesome. It even has the drawback of not being removal &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; Humans, which makes me further impressed with the design. This is the kind of Tribal card I like, as opposed to nonsense like Sparksmith or Silvergill Douser.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Champion of the Parish</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It's going to be hard to find a heavy white deck where you wouldn't run the Champion (5+ is probably enough), but he is rarely going to be that absurd. He seems worse than the premium commons, though if you can pick him up early enough you might as well.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Chapel Geist</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>A flying Kird Ape is pretty burly, even if it does take double white. Cards like this heavily incentivize you draft to build a 10-7 manabase, much like Armored Warhorse in M12 (but with an actual payoff instead).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Cloistered Youth</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>A 3/3 bashing on turn three is kind of a beatdown, but the more I see this card in play, the less I really like it. Losing a life every turn is a very substantial drawback, and with three common enchantments that lock it down, you can really get into trouble by flipping this. Plus, sometimes they just race it, and a few chump blocks later and you are dead. The card is fine, but I'm not a huge fan.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Dearly Departed</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Yay Dragons! It really takes some of the fun out of evaluating cards with interesting abilities when their base stats make them a 1st pick for any deck that can cast them.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Divine Reckoning</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Much like most Wrath variants, this is pretty solid when they don't see it coming. It sucks against bombs, but will be crippling against fast starts, and especially the token-based strategy. You won't tend to get a ton of value off the flashback, though it isn't nothing.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Doomed Traveler </CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I'm more impressed with this guy than I thought I'd be. He isn't much in Sealed, but he was put to good effect in both of the drafts I did. He fits well into the white token/sacrifice type of deck, with Thraben Sentry and Unruly Mob, as well as cards like Demonmail Hauberk. If you can't take advantage of him, he isn't great, though he still is a solid card against green decks, possibly out of the sideboard.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Elder Cathar</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is yet another card that fits into white's themes, but unlike the Traveler and the like, it takes no work to make Cathar decent. All you need is other creatures, preferably humans, even though any type is fine.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Elite Inquisitor</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>In Limited, a 2/2 first strike + vigilance guy for two can rightfully be called “elite”, and tacking on protection against a fairly solid chunk of the field doesn't hurt either. Plus, he's rare, so nobody expects him.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Feeling of Dread</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The effect here is powerful, under the right circumstances, but those circumstances don't seem like they will be incredibly common. It really is two colors, since half of the card isn't enough, and you have to be a fairly aggressive deck to really be interested in it. I feel that the decks that want this, really want this, but can also pick it up dreadfully late.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Fiend Hunter</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This may have the unfortunate side effect of dying at the most inopportune times, but you still aren't going to pass it very often. If you have good sacrifice effects, you can even sacrifice it in response to the trigger for a permanent exile, and even straight up it will usually just be removal. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Geist-Honored Monk</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>She doesn't monkey around; she comes in with friends, and will usually be big enough to dominate the board. Even if they have removal, you got a good deal on the exchange, and if you have a way to bring her back, more the better.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ghostly Possession</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I've been fairly unimpressed with this card so far; it's no Brink of Disaster. While it does shut down their biggest threat, they now have a blocker for your biggest threat, flying or not. If you have insane lategame or are just planning on swarming them with tokens, this is effective, but otherwise I'd only play it if I was desperate.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Intangible Virtue</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I would have to be pretty convinced that I was going to have 3-4 tokens a game before I'd play this, and so far that doesn't seem common. The card is undeniably powerful, so keep it in mind, but don't pick this early and try and build around, since it should wheel.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Mausoleum Guard</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I've been very happy with Mausoleum Guard. It almost always trades for more than just one card, and even in a chump block situation, it guards your life total for multiple turns. This seems like one of the key cards for the heavy white archetypes.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Mentor of the Meek</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It isn't exactly hard to utilize this in Limited; 90% of the creatures you would cast in white trigger it, and it even goes off when combined with all the token making. A windmill slam first pick for sure.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Midnight Haunting</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>In most sets, two 1/1's would be worse than a 2/2, but there are enough cool things you can do with tokens that the two guys are vastly better here. This seems better than the 2/1 first striker if your deck is good, but worse if it isn't very focused.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Mikaeus, the Lunarch</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Ajani Goldmane plus a 5/5 beater? Sign me up! Ideally you curve out and play Mikaeus on four or five mana, but even dropping him turn two or three is fine. He even splashes well, and you should rarely pass him.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Moment of Heroism</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This swings races pretty well, but doesn't combine all that well with white's main theme, which is a mass of small guys. The first one should be a decent addition, with subsequent ones losing some value. You just don't have the room to fill up your deck with too many non-creature spells.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Nevermore</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If they have multiple of the same flashback card (and it's named Devil&amp;#8217;s Play), &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt;, but probably not.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Paraselene</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This can obviously blow them out postboard, but it shouldn't touch your maindeck.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Purify the Grave</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If they have multiple ways to use the graveyard, and particularly Unburial Rites, this is a legitimate sideboard card.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Rally the Peasants</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Much like many of the multicolor flashback cards, the range of decks that want this is fairly narrow. The fact that it's so aggressive further decreases the number, since it isn't really a good splash, all of which means that the decks that &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; want it will get it. It is a very good reason to go RW tokens, since it gives you access to a powerful finisher that most decks won't take.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Rebuke</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Unlike previous incarnations, Rebuke is cheap enough that is isn't a complete telegraph when you leave mana up for it. Even if they know about it, it won't break the bank to leave three up most turns, and it kills anything that dares attack you. It does suffer a little against good players and utility creatures, but nearly unconditional removal is few and far between in this set.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Selfless Cathar</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Even in the token deck, this is a bit of a stretch. It definitely has some value, since it pumps Unruly Mob, flips Thraben Sentry, and can boost your squad, but it isn't a card you will play all that often. The more focused your deck, the more likely it is you play this, which means that usually it will be a good sign if it makes it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Silverchase Fox</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>He's about what he looks like: a Grizzly &lt;strike&gt;Bear&lt;/strike&gt;Fox with a slightly useful ability. You will play him more for the stats than anything else, but every now and then he will blow up a sick Curse or a Bonds of Faith.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Slayer of the Wicked</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Flametongue Kavu returns, and this time he's not as evil! He is going to miss in some matchups, but monsters appear in almost any color, so it won't be hard to get insane value out of this guy. Take him early and splash him, since he really is that good.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Smite the Monstrous</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Against non-green decks, this will mostly just hit their bombs, but that isn't actually a bad place to be. By forcing you to save your removal, Smite is actually making you play better. Hooray! </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Spare from Evil</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The Human mirror is pretty funny to watch. Both sides tend to have a bunch of cards that are pretty loose, like Bonds of Faith, the tapper, and Spare from Evil, all of which get drastically weaker. Of course, Spare from Evil wasn't that great to begin with, and I'd advise against maindecking it (though it's an ok sideboard card).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Spectral Rider</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If he was only a Human, he'd truly be something to fear, since all the equipment is insane on Humans. Even as just a Spirit, he still beats down effectively, and should get picked early as a result.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Stony Silence</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If they have a whole mess of equipment, you can consider this, but I'd need to see at least 3 before I'd be happy bringing it in.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Thraben Purebloods</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Much like the aforementioned Mastodon, you are never really happy to have a pack of hounds in your deck, but they end up there more often than not.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Thraben Sentry</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I really like this guy for Limited. He is one of the cards that utilizes white's token/sacrifice theme well, as well as being pretty reasonable just on his own. He isn't absurd, even when flipped, but he is definitely formidable, and works especially well with Butcher's Cleaver. Most white decks are going to want a couple of these guys to go along with their Doomed Travelers and Mausoleum Guards.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Unruly Mob</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Much like Thraben Sentry, I suspect that Unruly Mob is going to be an important card in draft. It rewards you for drafting around it, and can soon grow to unmanageable proportions. Once again, being Human is a fairly large bonus when it comes to equipment, and the Mob benefits greatly.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Urgent Exorcism</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I honestly don't know how to rate this card. It has ranged from awesome to dead enough times that I'm still not sold either way, though I would play it maindeck at this point. Getting rid of an enchantment like Claustrophobia, Bonds of Faith, or Sensory Deprivation is a huge blowout, and most decks have at least one or two Spirits to nuke. This doesn't seem like a high pick, but it seems like a reasonable card (albeit one you shouldn't be afraid to side out).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Village Bell-Ringer</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Nothing like a nice little ambush to start the day off right. You can't be too obvious with this, since passing on turn four or five with a large tapped creature out should set off their alarm bells, but at least the first time you might be able to get some value out of it. Plus, a Horned Turtle is a Horned Turtle, and I've always been a fan.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Voiceless Spirit</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is an efficient little package, good on offense or defense alike. You can never have enough of these guys, and they seem to come around pretty late.</RatingDescription>
