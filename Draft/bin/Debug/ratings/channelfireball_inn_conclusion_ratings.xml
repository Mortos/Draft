  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Evil Twin</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Clone is already a very good card in Limited, and adding the one-shot Visara ability makes this especially evil. I don't like committing to multicolor cards too early, but this one is worth it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Geist of Saint Traft</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>While I would never cut Geist from an UW deck, don't go too nuts here. All they need is a 2/2, and you are just trading, with a little damage thrown in for good measure. It is an extremely dangerous card, but still not better than a good removal spell.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Grimgrin, Corpse-Born</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This barely misses out on the exalted 4.0, but having to invest in a creature before getting any return can be costly. Brimstone Volley conveniently always kills him, and if you are short on creatures, they may not even need to. He is insane when left unchecked, but that isn't going to happen often enough to warrant calling him the best of the best.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Olivia Voldaren</CardName>
    <Rating>5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Is this really necessary? Only being multicolor keeps her from supplanting Devil's Play as the best card in the set, and even then she just might take the cake. I've played both with and against Olivia, and if she survives, she's actually just straight up unbeatable. If you are either color, even if it's pack 3, slam her, and if you aren't either, consider switching.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Blazing Torch</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The first ability is actually very relevant now, even if it still pales in comparison to the second. Torch is an excellent morbid enabler, a cheap piece of removal, and even grants some limited evasion. What's not to love?</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Butcher's Cleaver</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you have 5+ humans, this is an easy pick and an auto-play. If you don't, it's still reasonable, but really not all that special. In most decks, I can take it or cleave it, but the ones that want it, REALLY want it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Cellar Door</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I won't completely rule out the possibility of siding it in, but I doubt things will ever get to that point. You just can't pay this much mana for this small of an effect, and it is inefficient regardless of who you are targeting.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Cobbled Wings</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The dorkier the deck, the better Cobbled Wings becomes. Miser cards like this have always been friends with bad decks, and randomly giving a Werewolf flying does the trick more often than not. It is also a fine sideboard card against a deck with a bunch of non-flying defenders and/or flying attackers.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Creepy Doll</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This creates a pretty formidable barrier on the ground, even if it does die to Dead Weight. It even gets to bash, if need be!</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Demonmail Hauberk</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I've seen this card be a giant beatdown and a complete mulligan, mostly based on the decks it was played in. It goes very well in the W/x token deck, and is pretty much horrible in anything else. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Galvanic Juggernaut</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The untap mechanic on this is definitely not all drawback. When you have a tapped Juggernaut and mana up, any attack they make risks getting blown out by a timely removal spell, and once they are in chump block mode, the drawback might as well not exist. In a deck with actual zero removal, Juggs does get jammed up, so uh, try and draft removal.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Geistcatcher's Rig</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It turns out that adding a mana and making the ability much worse, makes the card vastly inferior to Stingerfling Spider. It also turns out that Stingerfling was absurd, and even a bad copy is still pretty awesome.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ghoulcaller's Bell</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You would have to have the actual nut flashback deck before this became good, and even then, can't you find something, anything, better.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Graveyard Shovel</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Not having a choice slows this down nearly to the point of uselessness, though if they are really light on graveyard enablers, it might still be enough.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Grimoire of the Dead</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This I'm not completely sure about, but a card with suspend 3 that wins you the game seems like it has to be good. It's not going to help you if you are getting beat down, but it will give you a path to victory if you are able to stall. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Inquisitor's Flail</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I haven't run across the deck that wants this yet, since it seems best on evasion guys, but they usually don't have high power. Putting this on a random 4/4 just seems like bad value, which really limits the uses for this.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Manor Gargoyle</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is pretty sweet. You get a permanent ground blocker, and one with enough teeth to dissuade most attacks, as well as a slightly-less permanent 4/4 flying beater. Sounds good to me!</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Mask of Avacyn</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Once you've paid the small fortune of an equip cost, you are rewarded with the Fort Knox of creatures, which seems like a fair deal. Some decks have a huge problem dealing with this, since unless they have a bunch of large creatures, they aren't killing your guys ever.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>One-Eyed Scarecrow</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I'm in the camp of starting this and siding it out when it's unneeded, but I also tend to draft the durdle control decks that want cards like this. It halts most early assaults efficiently, and pitches in to reduce flying damage later. I still think it shouldn't be able to handle a Blazing Torch; I know I wouldn't if I were a scarecrow!</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Runechanter's Pike</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>First strike and +2/+0 is already enough to win the vast majority of combats, and getting two spells in the bin doesn't seem unduly difficult.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Sharpened Pitchfork</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is another equipment that is mediocre outside of the human deck and very good in it, and it even has a pretty sweet picture as a bonus.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Silver-Inlaid Dagger</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I'm not a huge fan of Bonesplitter, and even at +3/+0, you need the right combination of evasive creatures to make this really sweet. Much like all equipment, it does work well with tokens and whatnot, which is a consideration. Also, how does this not do something special to the Werewolves?</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Traveler's Amulet</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is like a Caravan Vigil, but actually good. Not needing any particular color to get rolling is huge, and I like this in all but the most curve-tastic two-color decks, as well as obviously any three-color ones.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Trepanation Blade</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I really don't have a good sense of how effective this is, but even hitting two or three every time still makes it fairly mediocre. Like any power-boosting equipment, the more evasion guys you have the more likely you are to be interested.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Witchbane Orb</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If they have Curse of Death&amp;#8217;s Hold, then maybe you can entertain notions of bringing this in. Restrain yourself otherwise.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Wooden Stake</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Some deck want the slight bonus, but most are just going to side this in against the multiple Vampire deck. Branch out, see what feels best to you.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Enemy M10 Duals</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Any time you need both colors, they are obviously in, and they are actually pretty important when you are trying to splash. I wouldn't want to pick any early, but they make good wheel cards.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Gavony Township</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I would look to splash this if I were either color, since it's just that powerful. Once you can start throwing counters on your guys for free, the game is usually all but over.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ghost Quarter</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Rarely is your mana good enough to just randomly maindeck this, though it makes a fine sideboard card against the rare lands.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Kessig Wolf Run</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This one isn't quite as absurd as Township, since it isn't a permanent bonus, but it still can be pretty brutal. Aggressive decks are much more interested, and the Wolf Run is more of a lategame finisher than anything else.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Moorland Haunt</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>When every guy that dies comes with a 1/1 flying Spirit tacked on, the game doesn't tend to last very long. Soon you have a horde of 1/1's, and your hapless opponent is reduced to birdfood.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Nephalia Drownyard</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If you are three colors, this is the card for you. If you aren't, stay as far away as you can, since voluntarily getting your spells Sphere of Resistance'ed seems like a bad plan.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Stensia Bloodhall</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Of all the good lands, this helps stabilize the least, and really is only good for finishing them off. It does that reasonably well, but isn't as exciting as the GW or RG incarnations.</RatingDescription>
