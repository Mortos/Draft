    <CardName>Archangel’s Light</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>PV called this the “reverse Hysterical Blindness”, which should already tell you about where it stands, and that’s without factoring in that it is actually worse. It isn’t a Fog, just a very bad trick, and the only time I could see myself casting this would be if I sided it in against some kind of sweeper.</RatingDescription>

    <CardName>Break of Day</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Now this is a combat trick. “Eldrazi Monument my team” is going to ruin someone’s day, and even just +1/+1 is pretty solid for two mana. I wouldn’t be completely ashamed to play this straight up, and the bonus at the end is very relevant.  </RatingDescription>

    <CardName>Burden of Guilt</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’m not a huge fan of getting 2 for 1’ed, and make no mistake, this is you losing a card. The Burden trades for a guy, but you are pretty much obliged to lose the use of a land each turn, which makes this pretty horrendous in multiples. The first one is probably fine, since late game it works well, but I wouldn’t want multiples.</RatingDescription>

  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of Exhaustion</CardName>
    <Rating>0</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Actual 0’s are pretty rare in Limited, but this manages to get there. Spending a card to make it so they have to do what they were probably doing anyway is terrible, and they would have to have quite the concoction to make me change my mind. Even the most flashback-heavy deck is still full of instants, and can very easily just cast one spell on each player’s turn and be fine. </RatingDescription>

    <CardName>Elgaud Inquisitor</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is closer to Mausoleum Guard than it might appear on first inspection, since lifelink really does make up for the loss of a token. He might give you half the amount of value when he dies, but he has an ability that makes them actively want to kill him, which is the opposite of the Guard. You go from making bad trades or chumping to getting a real card and at least 2 life from the original body, which more than makes up for it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Faith’s Shield</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Despite traditionally hating combat tricks, this does only cost one, and has a few bonuses. It can protect your equipment and enchantments, possibly even a planeswalker if you are lucky enough to have one, but the biggest extra is the pseudo-Falter effect once you hit five. That is exactly the kind of thing that makes fateful hour sweet, and this card will definitely be one of the ones to keep an eye on as a result.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Gather the Townsfolk</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It’s going to be hard to actually cut this from your deck, even if a sorcery-speed Raise the Alarm isn’t much to look at. It works well with most of the Human effects, particularly equipment, and every now and then it is actually Conqueror's Pledge in disguise.</RatingDescription>

    <CardName>Gavony Ironwright</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’ve always liked Horned Turtles, so you can imagine how much I like a Horned Turtle that turns into a super-Crusade once you get to five life (hint: the answer is “a lot”).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Hollowhenge Spirit</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You are rarely going to get a whole card with his ability, though the potential is there. You can ambush 1/1’s, screw up their double blocks, or save a guy from a pump spell, but mainly you are just going to gain a few life by Fogging an attacker. That is still pretty reasonable on a 2/2 flier for four, making this a fine card.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Increasing Devotion</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’m first picking this even without the flashback, and the flashback is actually insane. The first shipment of tokens lets you live until the second wave, at which point they better have a Rolling Temblor or die.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Lingering Souls</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’d definitely splash either half of this card, though it is obviously much better to be base white splashing the flashback. In Constructed, there are legitimate reasons to want Midnight Haunting over Lingering Souls; in Limited, this is a great first pick and Midnight Haunting is just a good card. </RatingDescription>

  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Loyal Cathar</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’m not one to turn down a solid 2 for 1, especially one that goes right into WB Human Sacrifice, my favorite archetype. I can’t imagine any white deck, regardless of how controllish, that won’t want as many of these as it can get.</RatingDescription>

    <CardName>Niblis of the Mist</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Giving Crossway Vampire flying and making it a little smaller is a pretty serious upgrade, and Niblis of the Mist is one of the reasons that white-based beatdown is still a very good strategy with Dark Ascension.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Niblis of the Urn</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is actually better than Niblis of the Mist in a dedicated aggro deck, since it makes it extremely difficult for them to ever effectively block, but it is enough worse on defense that non-aggressive decks just won’t want to play it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ray of Revelation</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Much like the rating indicates, I would never maindeck this. That doesn’t make it bad, and it’s a great sideboard card, but don’t take it early, and don’t maindeck it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Requiem Angel</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Dragons just aren’t what they used to be. Much like Dearly Departed, the days where you could just windmill slam the Dragon are over, and I can easily see myself taking a good removal spell or a cheap creature instead. Casting this and getting it Silent Departured is sure an easy way to lose the game, and the problem isn’t limited to just Silent Departure.</RatingDescription>

  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Silverclaw Griffin</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Three is an impressive amount of first strike damage, making this effective on offense or defense. It’s very nice that it forces them to play their tricks first, opening them up to easy 2 for 1’s when you actually have it. As usual, don’t overload on 5’s, but if you have to choose one, this is usually going to be it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Skillful Lunge</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Even a much weaker version of Moment of Heroism is a solid playable, and this is definitely weaker. There are obviously situations where the Moment isn’t right, and if you are skillful enough to take advantage of them, this should work out well. Also, its similarity to Moment is going to make playing around both easy, except the times where they are actually different, and I think you are going to get some people pretty well in those cases.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Sudden Disappearance</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This card might as well read “your creatures are unblockable until end of turn”, since that’s what it’s actually going to do 9 out of 10 times. Once in a while, you will use it on yourself to reuse a Morkrut Banshee or something, but it really is just a Falter. Still, Falters are good, and this does the job quite well.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Thalia, Guardian of Thraben</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Thalia would be a good playable even without any ability besides first strike, which is good, since her other ability isn’t even guaranteed to help you more than your opponent. Every now and then you will play against a real durdle of a deck (often piloted by me), and she will be a legitimate hoser, but that isn’t going to be the most common scenario. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Thraben Doomsayer</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’m hesitant to compare this to Bloodline Keeper, since Keeper is just broken, but Doomsayer is still pretty good. Strategically activating Fateful Hour is insane with this guy, and he does a nice job of letting you sculpt a board that will allow you to survive once you hit low life. Plus, how are &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; surviving an army of 3/3’s?</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Thraben Heretic</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It might seem like heresy to advocate taking a creature over a removal spell, but the effect this card has on the game is so big that I’m doing just that. She hoses undying, Skaab decks, Unburial Rites, Ghoulraiser, and the list goes on, as well as being a solid 2-drop for your aggro deck.</RatingDescription>
