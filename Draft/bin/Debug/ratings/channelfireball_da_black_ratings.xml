    <CardName>Black Cat</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’ve always been a big fan of Doomed Traveler, and this is really the same sort of thing. A random card from their hand is usually worse, and Cats aren’t Humans, but this still fills out your curve and gives you a decent thing to sacrifice to various effects. Plus, who doesn’t love to spin the wheel on random effects?</RatingDescription>

    <CardName>Chosen of Markov</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It doesn’t take many Vampires to make this a card I’m satisfied with, and some decks will even play it just because it’s a Human. Turn three Chosen, turn four Vampire + flip isn’t very hard to assemble, and it isn’t like you have to use high picks on this.</RatingDescription>

  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of Misfortunes</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Bitterheart Witch is already suspect, and that’s given that you have Curse of Death’s Hold, and there haven’t been any particularly effective new Curses printed. Losing the ½ Deathtouch body in exchange for the ability to find more terrilbe Curses is pretty clearly not worth it, making this a card I’m likely never going to play.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of Thirst</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I dream of the day when I get to play this in draft, but I suspect it will never come.</RatingDescription>

    <CardName>Deadly Allure</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>In a good self-milling deck, this might not cost an entire card slot, at which point it becomes only mediocre instead of just bad. It does give you a removal spell, albeit one that costs 1.5 cards most of the time, since you are presumably losing a creature as well. If you have to, you have to, but I wouldn’t be happy about it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Death’s Caress</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Removal is removal, and the fact that this gains some amount of life from time to time makes up for the fact that it costs five and is a sorcery. Plus, it actually kills anything, which isn’t all that common in removal spells in this block.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Falkenrath Torturer</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is by no means a stellar card, but the combination of giving you a sac outlet, having flying when necessary, occasionally growing large, and just plain being a vampire all add up to a card I’m not terribly unhappy to play.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Farbog Boneflinger</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>As it turns out, a much, much worse Skinrender is still very good. I miss Skinrender.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Fiend of the Shadows</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I’d call this the new Sky-Eel School, but that sells Sky-Eel School short. Five-mana 3/3 fliers have never been bad, and coming with a pair of pretty sweet bonuses isn’t the worst. I’ve yet to cast a card off this, but the the day will come, I’m sure of it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Geralf’s Messenger</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Triple-black makes this a 6-drop in the real world, since it’s pretty tough to make a deck that isn’t close to split down the middle in colors. If by some miracle you end up playing 12+ Swamps in your deck, the card is great, but that isn’t going to be the case the vast majority of times. Even as more of a sixth turn play, it’s still very good, but you don’t need to take this really aggressively.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Gravecrawler</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It seems supremely annoying to have to keep dealing with this guy, especially since you probably start off the game by taking 4-6 damage if he’s played turn one. Granted, a random Armored Skaab can shut him down, but some reasonable percentage of games he’s just going to keep coming in for two damage a turn, over and over.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Gravepurge</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Cycling when you want to is good, and bringing back an entire army in the super late game is good, so even though a 3-mana Ghoulcaller’s Chant isn’t, this is flexible enough to be a card I want one of in most of my decks.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Gruesome Discovery</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>There are certainly matchups where this shines, but so many decks in this format are aggressive, and as much as I like to durdle, this just crosses the line. Keep it in the board for the control decks.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Harrowing Journey</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is basically just a split card of Ancestral Recall and Fireball, so obviously it’s a great Limited card. Most games you are going to be targeting yourself, but when you have an aggressive draw or just draw this very late, it can easily be used to kill them (and for the double crown, go for decking plus life loss at the same time).</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Highborn Ghoul</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Assuming BB isn’t too much of a stretch, this card obviously does a good job of beating down. It even has the option of blocking, a luxury Vampire Interloper can’t afford.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Increasing Ambition</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>As with most Tutors, how good this is directly correlates to the best cards you can get. If you spend so much mana doing nothing, the card you get not only has to be good, it has to make up for the time lost. Blasphemous Act is the perfect target, but most bombs will do just fine. The flashback isn’t even outrageous, and if your first target stabilizes the board, the flashback should flat out win the game.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Mikaeus, the Unhallowed</CardName>
    <Rating>4.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Do you know how many abilities Mikaeus has? I mean seriously, look at it. Every time he’s been in play, I’ve discovered a new one, and all of them are ridiculous. Open this, slam it, and be happy.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Ravenous Demon</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>The way I see this being played most of the time is as a random 4/4 that threatens to kill them if they tap out, which isn’t a bad place to be. Every now and then you are going to have to just flip it and pray they don’t have Claustrophobia, but that is pure upside. Nine-power tramplers are generally a good thing, and it fits perfectly in the BW Humans deck.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Reap the Seagraf</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You need both halves of this card to be live for it to be good, but the blue part is fine even as a splash. It is no Moan of the Unhallowed, but they can’t all be winners.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Sightless Ghoul</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Despite Conley’s claims that he got DESTROYED by this at the prerelease, it isn’t a very good card. If you need the Zombie and need a 4-drop, he does the trick, but you usually don’t need it that bad.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Skirsdag Flayer</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>By himself, Flayer is a slow removal spell, but combined with a few chumps, he turns into your very own Visara. I’m happy taking this early and building around it, all while knowing that I can just play it in a random RB deck and not worrying about my human count.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Spiteful Shadows</CardName>
    <Rating>0</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Actual zeros are few and far between, but this does win the prize.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Tragic Slip</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Unlike most Morbid cards, it is really easy to trigger this, since keeping one mana up has almost no cost. Without Morbid, it would be playable, and it is straight up Swords with, making this great and splashable.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Undying Evil</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Saving your guy and making it bigger isn’t the worst, and when you have nonsense like Farbog Boneflinger to abuse, it gets downright evil. Depending on your creature configuration, this loses some luster, but the first Undying Evil is generally going to be a solid addition.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Vengeful Vampire</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>As one of the few Undying guys that can actually block, Vengeful Vampire certainly doesn’t suck. He is as vulnerable to bounce or Claustrophobia as any six-drop, but it past that it’s pretty hard for them to get by him without losing a card.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Wakedancer</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is one of the biggest reasons not to just blindly trade guys on turn three in this format, but for now it seems to net a Zombie more often than not. Worst comes to worst, it’s a vanilla Human that you can use for many nefarious purposes, so I’m a fan.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Zombie Apocalypse</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Some decks will play this just because they have enough Zombies, but if it’s just doing that, it isn’t really worth of the name ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE. Against a few decks at the table, it’s going to be a giant beating, and probably worth maindecking just because of that huge upside. Also, ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.</RatingDescription>
