    <CardName>Afflicted Deserter</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I play Tormented Pariah more often than I'd like to admit, and this is basically the same thing with a really awesome bonus some of the time. Having the ability to just at any time pass the turn and smash one of their artifacts to smithereens is awesome, and costs you only a point of power off of an already playable card.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Alpha Brawl</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It is the alpha and the omega, and rightfully costs 8 mana as a result. Much like Insurrection, it is going to win the game much of the time, but requires them to have a bunch of creatures and again, costs a ton of mana. Not every deck can play eight drops, and I wouldn't just toss this into any deck without considering how you are going to make the game last long enough to cast it.</RatingDescription>

  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Blood Feud</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Any Twinstrikes? It shouldn't be too hard to figure out a way to get them with this, and worst comes to worst, your big guy eats their small one. I've been pretty impressed with this so far.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Burning Oil</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Burning Oil is more than fine if you can't flash it back, and quite good if you can. So far, it mostly has been played in R/x decks with only a few ways to get white mana, since RW is a pretty horrible color combination in general. I'm not unhappy to take this early.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Curse of Bloodletting</CardName>
    <Rating>0</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Target opponent loses half their life for five mana is in no way a good card, and it even rounds down (since 5 life really becomes 3, etc). I really wish Curses were pushed a little more aggressively, since they are a pretty cool mechanic.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Erdwal Ripper</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>As long as you can deal with the mana cost, you have a solid card on your hands. Even if it doesn't have the opportunity to start off as a 3/2, a two-power guy is generally worth a card at any point in the game. </RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Faithless Looting</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Most decks don't need more than 5-6 lands at any one time, so even though you end up down a physical card, you effectively are going to be up 1-2 cards by using this, as well as increasing card quality. It may not be Merfolk Looter, but it's surprisingly close, and I've been impressed so far.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Fires of Undeath</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Either half of this is playable (and the first half is straight up good), it's in one of the best color combinations, and it's the best red common. Is there anything else?</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Flayer of the Hatebound</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Even without any work at all, this is a board-dominating play, and with a few sac outlets it becomes pretty sick. That isn't even taking into account what happens if a different Undying guy dies, but you'd have to be the luckiest person on the planet for that to happen.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Fling</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Fling isn't a card I'd play in every deck, but it doesn't take much to make it a fine 23rd card. It obviously works quite well with Undying guys, particularly Nearheath Stalker, and is a passable finisher in an aggressive deck.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Forge Devil</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I'm always going to maindeck the first of these, and usually the second, but I won't be afraid to sideboard them out when applicable. It should be pretty easy to tell when they aren't good, and even when they are good, they aren't really exciting.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Heckling Fiends</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You aren't really paying too much for the body here, and the ability can lead to some nice blowouts. Sometimes in an aggressive deck you will just make them hit you so you can hit them back, as well as the obvious use of nabbing free cards when you have good blocks available.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Hellrider</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Hellrider delivers a huge beatdown, but is still not all that much more insane than a Hill Giant on many boards. You already want to be aggressive in this format, so it's definitely a threat, but I still don't see myself taking this over Flames of Undeath. Some games they will just be dead to Hellrider, but removal is still removal.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Hinterland Hermit</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Hinterland Hermit is about exactly as good as he looks, which isn't exciting. As a 2-drop, he's not getting cut very often, but nobody is ever excited to draft or play this card. Be aware that “must be blocked” is also not all that powerful, since they still get to choose how to block him, a fact I've seen it strike unnamed Team CFB members learn the hard way.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Increasing Vengeance</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>If your deck is very sweet, this card certainly increases in value, but most decks aren't going to have the roster of spells necessary to take advantage of it. You need 5+ good and cheap spells; any less and it's going to be hard to get this off the ground.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Markov Blademaster</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Getting it to connect the first time is the only hurdle, since once it becomes a 3/3 it's nigh-unstoppable. I'm sure between Nightbird's Clutches, Crossway Vampire, and the numerous removal spells, it will find a way in.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Markov Warlord</CardName>
    <Rating>3.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You can't afford to play too many curve-toppers, but this is one of the better ones. If it doesn't immediately kill them, it gets pretty close, and there isn't much they can do about it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Mondronen Shaman</CardName>
    <Rating>4</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Dearly Departed is one thing, and this is completely another. Firebreathe your entire team is an enormous game, and a 5/5 flier is nothing to scoff at either.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Nearheath Stalker</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>It's pretty nice tapping out for a five-drop and being safe from most removal spells, and being able to get into combat without fear isn't shabby either. The stats here make this just look bad, but it plays well.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Pyreheart Wolf</CardName>
    <Rating>1.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Pyreheart Wolf is another example of the small things adding up. It's rare that the Wolf will end the game in a single attack, though that does happen, but it does a good job of forcing through a few points, coming back as a real creature, and then forcing through a few more. You obviously don't want this unless you are aggressive, which is most red decks in this format.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Russet Wolves</CardName>
    <Rating>2</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>Hey, at least it's an upgrade to Riot Devils. This does about what you expect for your curve and creature count, but you are never happy about it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Scorch the Fields</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>This is a sideboard card, and a bad one at that. Some decks will have enough 1/1 Humans that it's worth it, but it's going to be rare that you actually want it.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Shattered Perception</CardName>
    <Rating>1</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>You have to be going pretty deep with flashback and other graveyard shenanigans to want this, and be assured that nobody else at the table will. I look forward to playing with it, even though I know BenS will yell at me when I do.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Talons of Falkenrath</CardName>
    <Rating>0.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>I don't know how many Invisible Stalkers you need before this becomes a bad 23rd card, but I hope I never find out.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Torch Fiend</CardName>
    <Rating>2.5</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>A two-drop with a minor bonus isn't something you are going to turn away, even if you don't have a burning desire to pick it in the first place.</RatingDescription>
  </CardRatingsItem>
  <CardRatingsItem>
    <CardName>Wrack with Madness</CardName>
    <Rating>3</Rating>
    <RatingDescription>There aren't too many things that live through this, so unless you have the misfortune of facing down the dreaded Fortress Crab deck, it does the job.</RatingDescription>
